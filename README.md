Turn [@npaulflavius](https://twitter.com/npaulflavius)'s [100 Days UI design](http://www.100daysui.com/) into reusable web components (React)!

Developed by [@quietshu](https://github.com/quietshu) with React and Less, open sourced with the MIT license.

Preview: [quietshu.github.io/100-days-ui](http://quietshu.github.io/100-days-ui/).

## Tech details

Those components are all writen for React, with ES6 and Less. So I strongly recommend to use [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle your project. 

And the demo (including webpack config, babel config, package.json and jshint config) will be on the [build-sap](https://github.com/quietshu/100-days-ui/tree/build-sap) branch (:construction:). 

In the meantime, I will write about all I have learned from thinking about and deconstructing those UI designs, developing these code, any kinds of insights. Please feel free to contact me or open an issues. 

BTW, the gh-pages branch (preview page) is built with [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router).

I think this <100-days-ui/> project will be kind of experimental practice. I'd like to try (discover) some layout/animation design concepts in this project (especially the [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion), I love it!). 

## About

All design works (PSD) by [100daysui.com](http://www.100daysui.com/).
